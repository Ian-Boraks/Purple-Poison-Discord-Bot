This disscord bot is used to set up and maintain the #9370DB CTF discrod server.

To use the bot, you need to create a file in the root called `api.py` and the contents should follow:
```
api = "<Insert your API key>"
guild = [<Guild 1>, <Guild 2>, <Guild n>] # Put your server IDs in this array.
```
